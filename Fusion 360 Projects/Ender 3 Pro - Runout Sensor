# Ender 3 Pro Filament Runout Sensor

### Idea:

    Can't find a model I like so I'm going to create my own to repurpose the stock Z endstop which is a limit switch with a lever on it.


### Project Details:

    1. Need to reuse the existing switch
    2. Needs to be as small as possible
    3. Needs to mount to the X gantry to the left of where the extruder motor used to be
    4. If a bearing is to be used, design it to use a 608 open bearing
