z_positions:                       # Left and right Z motor locations in space. This will be off the build plate. (Ender 3 Pro, steppers are to the back left and back right while looking at the front of the unit).
                                   # Coordinates below are in x,y from the 0,0 point which is directly under the nozzle at the front left of the build plate (3mm in from the left and front of the build plate).

# To get the X location value of the stepper's position follow this:

# This is the left stepper. Home and jog nozzle to 0,0. Nozzle will be in front left corner of build plate 3mm in from the left and 3mm back from the front of the plate. Raise Z axis by 10 so it doesn't slam into the bed for the next step. Look top down at left Z coupler and jog Z axis up until the cutout on left stepper coupler is in line with Y axis pointing backwards. Looking at the back side of the printer, measure with a mm ruler starting from 3mm in on the build plate. Line it up with the split in the left Z coupler. That's the X value, -29.5mm. It's a negative number because it's to the left of 0,0. in Cartesian coordinates when looking at the printer from the front.

# This is the right stepper. Home and jog nozzle to 0,0. Nozzle will be in front left corner of build plate 3mm in from the left and 3mm back from the front of the plate. Raise Z axis by 10 so it doesn't slam into the bed for the next step. Look top down at right Z coupler and jog Z axis up until the cutout on right stepper coupler is in line with Y axis pointing backwards. Looking at the back side of the printer, measure with a long mm ruler starting from the cutout on the right coupler across the build plate to 3mm in from the left side of the build plate. That's the X value, 258.5mm. It's a positive number because it's to the right and back of 0,0. in Cartesian coordinates when looking at the printer from the front.

# To get the Y location value of the stepper's position follow this:

# This applies to both the left and right stepper motors as long as they're in line with each other (Ender 3 Pro, Prusa, etc.). Home and jog nozzle to 0,0. Nozzle should be in front left corner of build plate 3mm in from the left and 3mm back from the front of the plate. Raise Z axis by 10 so it doesn't slam into the bed for the next step. Jog Z axis until cutout on left coupler on stepper aligns with X axis (point inward towards bed to get accurate measurement). Put a post it note on the build plate in line with this cutout or stick the stock scraper in the cutout and lie it across build plate. Measure up to the scraper with the mm ruler, stay close to the left edge of the build plate, 3mm in from front of build plate backwards (along Y axis) until you are in line with the left Z coupling cutout (to the post it note or scraper). That's the Y value here, 92.00mm.

points:                            # The points to probe with the CRTouch on build surface. There's 2 for the Ender 3 Pro because only 2 steppers exist.
                                   
                                   # To find the X position value for the right stepper, do this side first. Move the X gantry all the way to the right, note the X value (251) in the GUI or KlipperScreen, drop CRTouch pin, jog the Z axis down a bit but don't push the pin up, use the pin to me asure against. Measure from edge of build plate to pin. In my case it's 27mm. Subtract 27 from the max X value of (251). 251-27 = 224. 224 is the right stepper X value for the position below. Do the same for the left side of the plate.
                                   
                                   # Y value is 122.50 which is half of the build plate (245). Y's max travel is 230. Y's min travel is -15. So, 230 minus negative 15 = 245. 245/2 = 122.50. The Z steppers are in line with each other so both use 122.50mm as seen below. Doing it this way will center the build plate under the probe and make sure probing takes place in the center of the plate so it doesn't flex.
