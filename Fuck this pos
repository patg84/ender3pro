z_positions:         # Left and right Z motor locations in space. This will be off the build plate. (Ender 3 Pro, back left and back right while looking at the front of the unit).
                     # Coordinates below are in x,y from the 0,0 point which is directly under the nozzle at the front left of the build plate.
                     # Make sure x,y below are indented 4 spaces or this won't work.

# To get the X value follow this:
# This is the left stepper. Home and jog nozzle to 0,0. Nozzle should be in front left corner of build plate 3mm in from the left and 3mm back from the front of the plate. Jog Z axis until cutout on left stepper coupler is in line with Y axis. Measure with a mm ruler from the nozzle to the center of the left Z rod. That's the X value here, -33.00mm.
    


To get the Y value follow this:

# This is the right stepper. Home and jog nozzle to 0,0. Nozzle should be in front left corner of build plate 3mm in from the left and 3mm back from the front of the plate. Jog Z axis until cutout on right coupler on stepper aligns with X axis (point inward towards bed to get accurate measurement). Put a post it note on the build plate in line with this cutout. Measure with mm ruler 3mm in from front of build plate backwards (along Y axis) until you are in line with the left Z coupling. That's the Y value here, 94.00mm.

    -33,94           # This is the left Z motor
    261,94           # This is the right Z motor


points:                            # Points to probe with CRTouch on build surface. There's 2 for the Ender 3 Pro because only 2 steppers exist.
                                   
                                  # To find the X position value for the right stepper, do this side first. Move the X gantry all the way to the right, note the X value (251) in the GUI or KlipperScreen, drop CRTouch pin, jog the Z axis down a bit but don't push the pin up, use the pin to me a sure against. Measure from edge of build plate to pin. In my case it's 27mm. Subtract 27 from the max X value of (251). 251-27 = 224. 224 is the right steppers X value for the position below. Do the same for the left side of the plate.
                                   
                                   # Y value is 120 which is half of the build plate. Y's max travel is 225. Y's min travel is -15. So, 225 minus negative 15 = 240. 240/2 = 120. The Z steppers are in line with each other so both use 120mm as seen below.

    50,120                         # Left stepper x,y.
    221,120                        # Right stepper x,y


speed: 50                          # How fast in mm/sec are we moving between probing points after the Z axis is raised. This should probably be under the horizontal_move_z command below.

horizontal_move_z: 5               # How far up are we moving the Z axis between left and right probing. High enough that it doesn't drag the nozzle across the bed.

retries: 6                         # How many times to retry until the tolerance is correct.

retry_tolerance: 0.0025            # Needs to be within this Z axis tolerance or else retries happen.
